This was my first time using Kotlin and Jetpack Compose so most of my time was spent reading documentation and getting familiar with the platform.

Things I would target for improvements given more time would be:

- reusing styling parameters and extracting defaults to helpers
- UI tests -- both snapshot tests for layout and resolution support and Compose tests for functionality of the UI
- data fetching and navigation support to mimic network requests and refreshing the contents UI
